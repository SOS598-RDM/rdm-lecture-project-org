* segregate all materials for a project in one directory
* organize according to prevailing conventions (e.g., R package structure)
* maintain a clear separation of data, method, and output while unambiguously expressing the relationship among them
* specify the computational environment used for the original analysis
* organize such that another person can know what to expect from the plain meaning of the file and directory names
* include README files

“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.”

Phil Karlton

#### Phil Karlton quote

---

#### naming things: principles for file and object names

* machine readable

  - regular expression and globbing friendly
      + avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensivity
  - easy to compute on with deliberate use of delimiters
      + example: *2017-11-17_berneilwash_oxygen_day_1.csv*

.footnote[J. Bryan [Naming things](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)]
  
--

* human readable

  - names contain info about the content
  - easy to figure out what what something is based on the name
      + *2016_salmon_counts.csv* conveys a lot of information about the object, and has far more meaning than *fishData.csv*
  
--

* play well with default ordering
